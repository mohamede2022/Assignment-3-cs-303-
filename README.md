# Assignment-3-CS-303
**Instruction Code:**

- Includes necessary header file(s).
- Defines the main function.
- Asks the user to input an infix expression and stores it in the infixExp variable.
- Checks if the entered infix expression is balanced using the isBalanced function. If unbalanced, an error message is displayed.
- If the expression is balanced, converts the infix expression to a postfix expression using the infixToPostfix function and displays the result.
- It appears that the queue-related code provided after the return 0 statement won't be executed because of the early return in the code.
- Elements are inserted into the queue using the enqueue method of the myQueue object, which is an instance of the CustomQueue class.
- The program displays the front element of the queue using the front method of the myQueue object.
- The program dequeues (removes) the front element from the queue using the dequeue method of the myQueue object. The dequeued element is then displayed.
- The program checks if the queue is empty using the isEmpty method of the myQueue object. It then prints "Yes" if the queue is empty and "No" otherwise. After dequeuing an element, the queue is not empty, so it would print "No."
- The program displays the number of elements in the queue using the size method of the myQueue object.

- Here are some examples that my code outputs:
